# toy

## intro

A small domain specific language. Primitives are CAD objects -- cubes and
cylinders.

Take a look at the `README.md` in the `master` branch for more details.

## todo

* remove dependency on FreeCAD.
* write interpreter in another language.
* new syntax
  * while parenthesis are just dandy, the syntax should help express
  some things better/easier than others.
* consider adding a type system

## libraries

[WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) is extremely cool.
Take a look at [three.js](https://threejs.org). The [examples](https://threejs.org/examples/) section is fascinating.

For non-web based engines, look at [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org).
